This is a very simple and basic restaurant management system coded using Java. 

o	Project Statement
An object-oriented programming-based project that implements a restaurant management system using Java. A restaurant can use our system to perform multiple tasks. Our system facilitates taking orders from customers whether dine-in or takeaway. It allows the employee to print receipts straight away for takeaway orders and wait till the table asks for the receipt for dine-in orders. The system also stores all the orders taken during the day to create a report at the end of the night. The manager views the report to make sure all the numbers are right. The manager can also view the employees that worked on said day.

o	Accomplished Objectives
Our main objective was to utilize OOP concepts learned during this semester with the basics of java to create a good restaurant system. After a lot of hard work, dedication, and consistency in working on this project, we can confidently say that we accomplished these objectives through this well-based, easy to use system.
